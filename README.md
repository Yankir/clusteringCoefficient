# clusteringCoefficient
This program reads a graph and it returns the global clustering coefficient of it.

To add the nodes (for example node1 is linked with node2) you type "node1 node2"\
To finish the graph in linux terminal and see the coefficient press "Ctrl + D"

If you want to use the input from a file just run "./clusterCoeff.c < file.txt" in linux terminal.\
There is an example file for you to use.

Just download the code and compile it with gcc, then you can run it in the terminal.
